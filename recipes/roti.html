        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Roti bread is an unleavened griddle bread from India that is similar to pita bread. Ideally, I use a traditional Indian roti griddle called a tava.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups durum wheat flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir flour, water, oil, and salt together in a medium bowl until well combined and pulling away from the sides. Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead until smooth and pliable, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a round. Working with one round at a time while all others are covered with a damp cloth, flatten with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll into 6- to 8-inch diameter circle. </li>
            <li> Heat a dry skillet or tava over medium-high heat. Cook one roti at a time in the hot skillet until golden with some darker brown spots, about 1 minute per side, As it cooks, roll the next roti. Serve warm. </li>
        </ol>
